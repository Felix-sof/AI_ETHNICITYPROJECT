# AI_ETHNICITYPROJECT
Project For The Ethnicity Recognition with Camera
This project is developed by Sanberk Doruk Çankaya, a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at Istanbul Beykent University. The project leverages Artificial Intelligence technologies and is built using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for ethnicity classification. The model’s training was implemented through the trainmodel function, applying an appropriate training process.

The project classifies ethnicities using images from various datasets. These datasets include Morph, UTKFace, FairFace, and CNSIFD. The processing and labeling of each dataset have been meticulously done to ensure that the model works accurately and effectively.

The training of the AI model has been accelerated by using Mixed Precision technology. Additionally, analyses such as ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and AUC (Area Under Curve) scores were performed to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

This is Sanberk Doruk Çankaya’s first AI-based project, and it provided valuable learning experiences throughout the development process.

Ethnicity Classification Datasets

For this project, we are using multiple datasets for ethnicity classification. One of the datasets, the Morph dataset, is subject to copyright and distribution restrictions. It is not openly available for public sharing, but it can be obtained through university channels by discussing the terms with the university administration.

On the other hand, datasets such as UTKFace, FairFace, and CNSIFD are openly available and can be accessed freely. These datasets provide a wide range of labeled data for ethnic classification, making them suitable for training and evaluation purposes.

Please ensure that you follow the legal and ethical guidelines when using these datasets, especially the restricted ones.
